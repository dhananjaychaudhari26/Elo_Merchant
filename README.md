Case Study: Elo Merchant Category Recommendation , Help understand customer loyalty
<h1> 1. Business Problem </h1>
<h3> 1.1 Description </h3>
<p>Elo is one of the biggest and most relaible payment brand in brazil, It planned a reward program to attract the customers based on customers loyalty score.
<h3> 1.2 Problem statement </h3>
<p>Elo wants to predict customers' loyalty based on the given features so they can give more offers to loyal customers which will be in favour of customers and merchants as well. (so they can target individual customers and avoid unnecessary campaigns).
<p>It seems like a recommendation but here we have to predict customersâ€™ loyalty score which is nothing but real value. So this is problem of regression</p>
